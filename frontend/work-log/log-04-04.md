## **Implemented Changes**

#### **Login Page (`/login`)**  
- Created a login form with fields for `username` and `password`.  
- Added client-side form validation to ensure username and password are provided before submission.  
- Displayed error messages when invalid login credentials are entered.  

#### **Login Functionality**

- Set up handling for invalid credentials by showing appropriate error messages on the UI.

- Set up logout functionality to clear the session and redirect users to the login page.  

#### **Frontend Route Management**

- Managed access control for different user roles (student/admin) and displayed appropriate routes based on the userâ€™s role.  
- Added route handling to ensure users without a session are redirected to the login page.  

#### **Logout Functionality**
