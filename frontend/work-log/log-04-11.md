## **Implemented Changes**

#### Firebase Authentication Setup
- Replaced frontend authentication from username/password to Firebase Google Sign-In.
- Restricted sign-in to UMBC email addresses using Firebase configuration.
- On first login, users are automatically registered via Firebase.
- Updated `Login.jsx`:
  - Displays loading prompt during login. -> plan to add a loading spinner 
  - Redirects user to the dashboard after successful login.

#### Login Page Styling
- Styled the login card using custom CSS to match the app's design.
- Included the UMBC logo on the login page for branding consistency.
- Added error handling to display error messages when login fails.
  
#### Private Route Setup
- Created a `PrivateRoute` component to protect routes based on user roles.
- Ensured only authenticated users with the correct role (student/admin) can access protected routes (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/admin`).

#### Sidebar Component Implementation
- Created a reusable `Sidebar` component for both students and admins.
- Sidebar includes:
  - User info display (with icon and name from Firebase).
  - A close (`âœ–`) button.
  - Logout button.
  - Placeholder button for future "Past Orders" feature.
  - **More future buttons to be included**
- Sidebar toggles open/close state using a `toggleSidebar` function.
- Clicking **anywhere outside** the sidebar now closes it:
- Applied styling to create a smooth and user-friendly slide-in sidebar from the left.
- **Plan to limit sidebar height only to main screen**

#### Firebase Admin SDK (Backend)
- Backend uses Firebase Admin SDK to verify user tokens and handle secure access.
- **Important:** The `admin-sdk.json` credentials file must be placed in the `/secrets` folder.
- This file is excluded from version control for security reasons (see `.gitignore`).
- Ensure the `admin-sdk.json` file is present locally when running the backend.

#### Frontend Environment Variables
- Frontend requires a `.env` file with all Firebase API keys and config:
```
 VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key 
 VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain 
 VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id 
 VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket 
 VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id 
 VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

#### Startup Script
**This eliminates the need for manual switching between terminals to run both backend and frontend.**
- Created a start.sh script to streamline the development process: This script automatically starts the backend and frontend with **one command.**
    - Backend is started in the background.
    - Frontend is started after the backend.

- How to use:
    - Place the start.sh script in the root project directory.
    - Make it executable: chmod +x start.sh.
    - Run the script: ./start.sh.
    - To exit the script, press Ctrl+C twice.

#### Dependencies

- Installed the following dependencies:
    - **Frontend**: `npm install firebase`
    - **Backend**: `pip install firebase-admin`


#### **Tests**
- Firebase authentication works as expected with:
  - Google Sign-In for UMBC emails.
  - Automatic user registration on first login.
  - Redirect to the correct page after login.
- Private routes successfully block unauthorized users from accessing restricted pages.
- Sidebar functionality:
  - Opens and closes properly via toggle and close button.
  - Closes when user clicks outside the sidebar area.
  - Displays correct user name from Firebase.

**Bug: Name of user is only displayed in the sidebar on second login attempt**

#### **Future Improvements**
- Add custom error messages for failed login attempts (e.g., incorrect credentials or network issues).
- Further UI refinements for login and dashboard.
- Implement better error handling for the Firebase authentication process.
- Add navigation links and role-based controls to the sidebar (e.g., show admin tools for admins only).
- Animate sidebar open/close transitions for smoother UX.
