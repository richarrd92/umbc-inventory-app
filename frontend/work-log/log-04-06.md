## **Implemented Changes**

### Login Response Fix
- Backend `/auth/login` now includes `id` in the response.
- Updated Pydantic `LoginResponse` model to include `id`.
- Updated frontend `Login.jsx`:
  - Extracts `token`, `role`, and `id` from response.
  - Shows an error if `id` is missing.

### Cart Page Styling & Improvements
- Created `Cart.css` for clean and consistent UI with the dashboard.
- Styled:
  - Item list
  - Quantity buttons (+ / - / Remove)
  - "Place Order" & "Back to Dashboard" buttons
- Layout:
  - Buttons placed in the same row using flexbox.
  - "Back to Dashboard" left-aligned.
  - "Place Order" right-aligned.

### Checkout Validation
- Added check before navigating to the cart:
  - Shows an alert if the cart is empty.
  - Prevents navigating to the cart page if nothing is selected.

## Tested
- Cart works correctly with:
  - Empty state
  - Adding/removing items
  - Prevents checkout if cart is empty
- Student checkout transactions are correctly appearing in the database
- Transaction note defaulted to `"Enter any additional notes here"` assumed admin responsibility to add notes after checkout

## Future improvement
- May need to add a note field, for future implementation if students must add notes after checkout.
- Better UI styling for student dashboard and cart page
- Future idea: replace `alert` with modal/toast for smoother UX.
