## **Implemented Changes**

This continues from the `Reia 99 admin add new item #21` PR. For database multi-user testing, run the main.sql file without executing the insert queries. I've already added two items `test1` and `test2` so ensure they appear in the available items list. No need to insert dummy data for users, orders, or transactions.

### Frontend Update

#### Conditional Rendering of Items Table

- **Student and Admin Dashboards**:
  - Fixed UI logic to **conditionally render the available items table**.
  - The table is now **only shown if there are items available** in the system.
  - Tested both student and admin dashboards to confirm conditional behavior.

### Cloud Database Integration

#### AWS RDS MySQL Setup and Connection

- **RDS Instance Configuration**:
  - Set up a **MySQL database instance** on **Amazon Web Services RDS** (non-Aurora).
  - Configured the instance to be **publicly accessible**, enabling secure remote connections.
  - Added appropriate **VPC security group rules**:
    - Allowed inbound access from known IP addresses.
    - Configured outbound rules to allow all traffic.
  - Verified availability and connectivity via AWS console.

- **SQLAlchemy + PyMySQL Integration**:
  - Established a database connection using SQLAlchemy with the PyMySQL driver.
    - Example connection string used:
      ```
      DATABASE_STRING=mysql+pymysql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database_name>
      ```
  - Environment variables securely loaded via `.env` file.

- **Database Initialization**:
  - Reused existing table creation logic from earlier development.
  - Added error-handling and detailed logging for connection failures (e.g., unknown database errors).

- **Testing and Verification**:
  - Validated successful connection and table creation locally.
  - Confirmed expected schema structure in RDS instance after running initialization script.

- **Next Steps**:
  - Secure credentials with AWS Secrets Manager (requires further research).
  - Implement automatic backup verification and failover testing.
  - Deploy app on cloud using a service like firebase
