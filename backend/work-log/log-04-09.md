### Summary:
This PR introduces changes to the backend to integrate Firebase authentication. With this update, user creation is now handled using Firebase UID and email, eliminating the need for password handling in the backend. The `password` field is no longer required for user creation or storage.

### Changes Made:

1. **Firebase Authentication Integration:**
   - Replaced password-based authentication with Firebase UID and email-based user creation.
   - Removed the `password` field from the `User` model and related Pydantic schemas.
   - Updated the `UserCreate` and `UserResponse` schemas to reflect the new authentication flow.

2. **Database Adjustments:**
   - Adjusted the database schema to remove the `password` field.
   - Modified the user creation logic to store only the `firebase_uid`, `email`, `name`, and `role`.

3. **User Creation Endpoint (`POST /users`):**
   - The user creation endpoint now accepts only `firebase_uid`, `email`, `name`, and `role`.
   - Validation before creation ensures that a userâ€™s email and Firebase UID are unique.
   - Soft deletion logic is retained to prevent creating users with the same email or Firebase UID that have been marked as deleted in the database.

4. **User Update Endpoint (`PUT /users/{id}`):**
   - Allowed partial updates for the user fields (`name`, `email`, `role`).
   - Ensured that changes to sensitive information (like email or role) are handled correctly.
   - Left password update optional incase we may need to let users(students) update their password
 
> **Get users or user endpoint left unchanged** - still works fine 


5. **Error Handling:**
   - Added error handling to the `POST /users` endpoint to catch any duplicate user issues and return meaningful error messages

6. **Soft Delete Handling:**
   - Implemented checks to handle soft-deleted users during user creation and updates. This prevents creating new users if there are already soft-deleted records with the same `firebase_uid` or `email`.

7. **PR Testing:**
   - Tested all crud operations on user functionality via Postman to ensure proper operation. test file in `/tests/firebase-user-endpoints.json` file
   - Verified that new users can be created without passwords and that error messages are clear and accurate.

**installed dependency:** `pip install firebase-admin` -> should be installed in the env

### Next Steps:
- Integrate Firebase Authentication on the frontend.
- Update the frontend to align with the new user creation flow (removing password handling).
- Revise frontend UI to accommodate these changes and ensure a seamless user experience.
