- **Warning**: Before running backend make sure to reset Local instance of your database, instructions below


## **Implemented Changes**  

#### **Create Transaction (`POST /transactions/`)**  
- Implemented transaction creation with validation checks for `item_id`, `user_id`, `quantity`, and `transaction_type`.  
- Ensured `created_at` is automatically set upon insertion.  
- Added error handling for invalid item or user references.  

#### **Read Transactions (`GET /transactions/` & `GET /transactions/{transaction_id}`)**  
- Implemented retrieval of all transactions with soft delete filtering (`deleted_at IS NULL`).  
- Added handling for missing or deleted transactions (`404 Not Found`).  
- Enabled transaction lookup by ID.  

#### **Update Transaction (`PUT /transactions/{transaction_id}`)**  
- Implemented selective field updates using `exclude_unset=True` to modify only provided fields.  
- Prevented modification of `created_at` and `id` fields.  
- Ensured validation of existing transactions before updates.  

#### **Soft Delete Transaction (`DELETE /transactions/{transaction_id}`)**  
- Implemented soft delete by updating the `deleted_at` timestamp instead of permanently removing records.  
- Ensured deleted transactions no longer appear in standard retrieval requests.  
- Prevented further modifications to deleted transactions.  

#### **Restore Transaction (`PUT /transactions/{transaction_id}/restore`)**  
- Implemented transaction restoration by resetting `deleted_at` to `NULL`.  
- Added validation to check if the transaction was actually deleted before attempting restoration.

### Reset Local Database Instance  
- Updated and combined files to set up database into one single file to prevent errors in the future when we update database sqlalchamey data:
    - instead of - `/database/schema.sql` & `/database/example.sql`, simply use `/database/main.sql`

- To align with the new schema and logic, Run the sequel commands in `/database/main.sql` one by one to drop all database tables and create new ones, then insert sample data
