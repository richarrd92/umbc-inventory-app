## Implemented Changes

#### **Create Item (`POST /items/`)**  
- Implemented item creation with validation checks for required fields (`name`, `quantity`, `restock_threshold`).  
- Ensured `created_at` is automatically set upon insertion.  
- Added error handling for duplicate item entries.  

#### **Read Items (`GET /items/` & `GET /items/{item_id}`)**  
- Implemented retrieval of all items and single-item lookup by ID.  
- Added handling for missing or deleted items (`404 Not Found`).  
- Supported filtering by category and user ID for better data retrieval.  

#### **Update Item (`PUT /items/{item_id}`)**  
- Used `ItemUpdate` to prevent unnecessary required fields (`id`, `created_at`, `deleted_at`).  
- Used `exclude_unset=True` in `item.dict()` to update only provided fields without overwriting others.  
- Ensured `created_at` and `deleted_at` remain unchanged unless explicitly updated.  
- Validated item existence before performing updates.  

#### **Delete Item (`DELETE /items/{item_id}`)**  
- Implemented soft delete by updating the `deleted_at` timestamp instead of permanently removing records.  
- Ensured deleted items no longer appear in standard retrieval requests.  
- Added validation to prevent modifying deleted items. 

 
## Other changes  

- Refactored item endpoint routes to align with the new user-based route prefixing. 
- Updated and combined files to set up database into one single file to prevent errors in the future when we update database sqlalchamey data:
    - instead of - `/database/schema.sql` & `/database/example.sql`, simply use `/database/main.sql`
- Before running backend make sure to reset Local instance of your database

#### Reset Local Database Instance  

To align with the new schema and logic, follow these steps:  
- Run the sequel commands in `/database/main.sql` one by one to drop all database tables and create new ones, then insert sample data

#### Future Considerations  

We may need to integrate Alembic for database migrations. Alembic helps manage schema changes in a structured way, ensuring version control for database modifications. This will allow us to apply, track, and rollback schema changes efficiently without disrupting data integrity.
